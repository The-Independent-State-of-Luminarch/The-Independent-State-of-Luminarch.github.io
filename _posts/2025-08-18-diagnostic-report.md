# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C which is close to the threshold of 50-55°C for most modern CPUs. This may cause throttling or instability issues if not addressed.
* The load average (averaged over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes) is relatively low, but it could be indicative of a system underutilized resource wise.
* The GPU temperature is at 50 C which might indicate overheating. 
* There are only about 1024 MiB of free GPU memory out of a total of 6144 MiB available.
* Memory usage is quite high (2480 MiB used) out of a total of approximately 32 GiB.
* The system has only about 4 GiB of swap space, which might be too little in case of sudden increases in memory demand.

Note that some of these are relatively minor and might not necessarily impact stability immediately. However, if left unaddressed, could cause issues down the line or lead to a complete system freeze.
