Here is a report on potential areas to improve stability based on the provided system information:

**Requirements for Improving Stability**

1. **Monitoring Temperature Sensors**
	* Issue: Temperature sensors are reporting high temperatures, with some reaching up to 36°C.
	* Recommendation: Install temperature monitoring software or hardware to ensure optimal operating temperatures and prevent overheating.
2. **Power Consumption Optimization**
	* Issue: Power consumption is high, with the system using 65% of its available resources on the root filesystem.
	* Recommendation: Review power management settings and consider upgrading to a more efficient cooling solution or optimizing system configuration for low-power operation.
3. **NVIDIA GPU Driver Issues**
	* Issue: NVIDIA GPU driver errors are reported in the kernel logs, indicating potential issues with driver installation or configuration.
	* Recommendation: Review and update NVIDIA GPU drivers to ensure they are up-to-date and properly installed.
4. **Smartmontools Analysis**
	* Issue: Smartmontools analysis reveals high temperatures on one of the disk drives (27°C).
	* Recommendation: Monitor temperature trends over time and consider upgrading or replacing the affected drive if temperatures continue to rise.
5. **Kernel Log Errors**
	* Issue: Kernel log errors indicate potential issues with VMX (outside TXT) disabled by BIOS.
	* Recommendation: Review system configuration and BIOS settings to ensure that VMX is properly enabled for optimal performance.

**Additional Recommendations**

1. **Perform Regular System Updates**: Ensure all installed software, including the operating system, kernel, and applications, are up-to-date to prevent potential security vulnerabilities and bugs.
2. **Conduct Disk Health Checks**: Run regular disk health checks using tools like `smartctl` or `ddrescue` to detect any potential issues with storage devices.
3. **Implement Proactive Monitoring**: Set up proactive monitoring of system resources, including CPU, memory, disk usage, network I/O, and temperature sensors, to quickly identify potential issues before they cause problems.

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can enhance the stability and reliability of your operation, ensuring that critical systems remain available when needed.

Based on the provided system information and report, here is a summary in Markdown format:

\# Node Status

\## OS & Kernel

\- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

\- Kernel: 3.63.x

\- Arch: x86-64

\> Constraints:

\> - OS: “Ubuntu <major>.<minor> LTS”

\> - Kernel: “<major>.<minor>.x”

\> - Arch: Use the input string as-is

\## CPU

\- Model: Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz

\> Constraints:

\> - Use model name + base clock verbatim

\## Memory

\- Total: 64 GiB, Used: 18 GiB, Free: 44 GiB, Available: 52 GiB

\- Swap: Total 0 bytes, Used 0 bytes

\> Constraints:

\> - Preserve numbers and units exactly as in the input.

\> - If a value is missing, omit that line instead of fabricating data.

\## Volumes

\- Volume 1: 439 GiB — 65 GiB, 352 GiB, 16%

\- Volume 2: 2.7 TiB— 2.8 GiB, 2.6 TiB, 1% ...

\> Constraints:

\> - Use only the first “Filesystem …” table found in the input.

\> - For each data row, read columns 2–5 only (Size, Used, Avail, Use%). Ignore column 1 (device name) and the last column (mount path).

\## Temperatures

\- CPU Package: 27°C

\- Cores: \[27°C, 33°C ...\]

\- ACPI: \[23°C, 33°C ...\]

\> Constraints:

\> - Round all temperatures to integers (e.g., 40.0°C → 40°C).

\> - Do not include Min/Max or other ancillary info.

# Final check

\- All output lines are safe from tokens starting with “/”.
