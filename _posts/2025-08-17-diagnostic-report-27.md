# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **Cooling System**: The CPU Temp is 49.0°C, which is above average. Consider upgrading or cleaning the cooling system to prevent overheating.
* **GPU Performance**: The GPU Memory is at 17% usage (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB), indicating underutilization of resources. Consider running resource-intensive applications or updating drivers for better performance.
* **System Resources**: The Mem and Swap usage are relatively low, with only 7-10% utilization. This indicates that the system has sufficient free resources and is not bottlenecked by memory constraints.
* **Disk Usage**: The Filesystem /dev/sda1 is at 42% usage, indicating potential disk space limitations. Consider expanding storage or deleting unused files to optimize disk performance.
* **System Load**: The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating minimal system activity and resource competition. This suggests that the system can handle increased loads without issues.
* **GPU Temperature**: The GPU Temp is at 50°C, which is relatively high but may not be a cause for concern depending on the specific hardware and usage patterns.

No additional measurement equipment purchases are necessary.
