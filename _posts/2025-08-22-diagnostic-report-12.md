# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Temperature
The current CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which is likely too high for optimal performance. The ideal operating range for most CPUs is between 30-50°C. A high temperature can cause throttling, reduce lifespan, and increase the risk of overheating-related failures.

## System Load
The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating that the system is not currently under heavy load. However, this does not necessarily mean that the system will remain stable in the future.

## GPU Temperature and Memory Usage
The GPU temperature is also high at 50 C, which may indicate a potential overheating issue. Additionally, the used memory (1024 MiB) is a significant portion of the total available memory (6144 MiB), which could impact performance.

## Memory and Swap Space Utilization
Memory usage (32082 KiB out of 32768 KiB) and swap space utilization are within acceptable limits.

## Filesystem Utilization
The /dev/sda1 filesystem is approximately 42% full, which may indicate a potential storage issue if the disk continues to fill up.

To improve stability and reliability:

* Implement temperature monitoring and cooling measures for the CPU and GPU.
* Regularly review system logs and adjust settings as needed to maintain optimal load average.
* Ensure sufficient airflow around the GPU and consider using a heatsink or watercooling solution.
* Monitor memory usage and implement measures to prevent excessive memory consumption.
* Consider expanding storage capacity to reduce the risk of filesystem filling up.
