# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling.
* The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but it's not clear if this is a normal or abnormal state for the system.
* The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is relatively high and may indicate that the graphics card is being pushed to its limits.
* The available memory is low (32082 2480 27602), which could lead to performance issues and crashes.
* The swap space is almost full (4096 0 4096), which can cause system slowdowns and crashes.
