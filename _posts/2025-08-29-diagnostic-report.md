# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is high at 49.0°C, which may lead to thermal throttling or even damage to the CPU over time.
* The load average is relatively low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but this could be due to various system processes running in the background and consuming resources.
* The GPU temperature is also high at 50 C, which may impact performance and longevity.
* Only 17% of the GPU memory (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB) is being utilized, indicating that the system may not be using the full capabilities of the GPU.
* The memory usage is relatively low (32082 2480 27602), but this could change depending on the tasks running on the system.
* There is 4 GB available swap space out of 4 GB total, which indicates that there may be some issues with disk storage or resource utilization.
* The root partition (/dev/sda1) is at 42% usage, indicating that there may be a need to clean up or free up space on the disk.
