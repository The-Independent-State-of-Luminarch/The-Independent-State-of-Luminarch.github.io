\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Temperature is High
The current CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which is relatively high and could lead to performance throttling or even damage to the CPU if not addressed.

## System Resource Utilization
The system load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating that there are sufficient resources available. However, this could be a sign of an underutilized system or inefficient resource allocation.

## GPU Temperature is High
The current GPU temperature is 50 C, which is also relatively high and could lead to performance issues or damage to the GPU if not addressed.

## Memory Utilization
The system memory usage is low (32082 MiB used out of a total of 32 MiB), indicating that there are sufficient resources available. However, this could be a sign of an underutilized system or inefficient resource allocation.

## Swap Space Utilization
The swap space usage is 0%, indicating that there are sufficient free swap space available.

## Filesystem Utilization
The root filesystem is utilized at 42% capacity, which may indicate a potential storage limitation if the system requires more space in the future.
