\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Temperature

*   The current CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating. 
    *   This can lead to reduced performance and increased risk of damage.
    
## Memory Usage

*   Memory usage is high at 32082/2480 with a Swap space also showing low availability, this could result in system crashes if not addressed properly.

## GPU Temperature

*   The current GPU temperature is 50°C. 
    *   This can indicate that the system is pushing the limits of the GPU, which may lead to reduced performance or damage.

## File System Utilization

*   The root partition `/` is using up a significant amount of space with 42% usage.
    *   This could result in a low disk space warning or an out-of-space error.
