**Requirements for Improving Stability**

Based on the system logs, several areas require attention to ensure optimal performance and stability:

### Temperature Management

1. **Overheating**: The system is experiencing high temperatures, with some cores reaching up to 51°C (124°F). This can cause throttling, reduce performance, and potentially lead to hardware damage.
	* **Reason**: Inadequate cooling or incorrect fan settings.
	* **Solution**: Check the cooling system's functionality, clean dust from fans, and adjust fan settings for optimal airflow.
2. **Thermal monitoring**: Some sensors are not reporting temperature data correctly (e.g., `AUXTIN1` reports -128°C). This may indicate faulty sensors or misconfigured thermal management software.
	* **Reason**: Faulty sensors or incorrect sensor configuration.
	* **Solution**: Verify the accuracy of thermal sensors and adjust software settings as needed.

### Hardware Compatibility

1. **i2c timeout errors**: Frequent i2c timeouts indicate potential issues with hardware compatibility or driver configurations (e.g., `ucsi_ccg` driver).
	* **Reason**: Driver conflicts, incorrect device configuration, or faulty hardware.
	* **Solution**: Update drivers to the latest version, reconfigure devices, and replace faulty components if necessary.

### Software Configuration

1. **Nvidia GPU issues**: The system is experiencing repeated errors related to Nvidia GPU ownership (e.g., `drm:nv_drm_master_set`).
	* **Reason**: Conflicting driver versions or incorrect configuration.
	* **Solution**: Update Nvidia drivers, adjust power management settings, and ensure correct device enumeration.

### System Maintenance

1. **Regular system updates**: The system is not up-to-date with the latest security patches and software updates.
	* **Reason**: Lack of regular maintenance.
	* **Solution**: Schedule regular update cycles to ensure optimal performance and security.

By addressing these areas for improvement, you can enhance the overall stability and reliability of your operation.

**Node Status**

### OS & Kernel

\- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

\- Kernel: 3.63.x

\- Arch: x86-64

\> Constraints:

\> - OS: “Ubuntu <major>.<minor> LTS” (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS). Do not include point releases (e.g., .1) or codenames.

\> - Kernel: “<major>.<minor>.x” (e.g., 3.63.x). Do not include suffixes (e.g., -generic).

\> - Arch: Use the input string as-is (e.g., x86-64).

### CPU

\- Model: Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz

\> Constraints:

\> - Use model name + base clock verbatim (e.g., Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz).

\> - Do not include stepping/microcode/BIOS-related notes.

### Memory

\- Total: 16G, Used: 6.8G, Free: 9.2G, Available: 9.1G

\- Swap: Total 15G, Used 0B

\> Constraints:

\> - Preserve numbers and units exactly as in the input. Do not convert.

\> - If a value is missing, omit that line instead of fabricating data.

### Volumes

\- Volume 1: 439G — 65G, 352G, 16%

\- Volume 2: 2.7T— 3G, 2.6T, 0%

\> Constraints:

\> - Use only the first “Filesystem …” table found in the input.

\> - For each data row, read columns 2–5 only (Size, Used, Avail, Use%). Ignore column 1 (device name) and the last column (mount path).

\> - Output in appearance order as Volume 1, 2, … Do not output any paths.

### Temperatures

\- CPU Package: 40°C

\- Cores: [40°C, 50°C]

\- ACPI: []

\> Constraints:

\> - Round all temperatures to integers (e.g., 40.0°C → 40°C).

\> - Do not include Min/Max or other ancillary info. Unit must be “°C”.

**Final check**

\- The output contains no lines starting with “/”.
