# Requirements for Improving Stability

## 1. **Monitoring Temperature Sensors**

The system's temperature sensors are reporting critical temperatures, indicating potential overheating issues.

*   The coretemp-isa-0000 adapter is showing high core temperatures (up to +37.0°C) on multiple cores.
*   The nct6791-isa-0290 adapter reports a SYSTIN temperature of +26.0°C, which exceeds the specified threshold (+25.0°C).
*   This may cause reduced system performance, hardware damage, or even complete system failure.

## 2. **Fan Control**

It appears that fan control is not functioning properly, as multiple fans are reporting zero RPM values (fan1, fan3, fan5).

*   This could be due to a faulty fan controller, a software issue, or inadequate cooling setup.
*   Ensure that the system's thermal management settings are configured correctly and that all fans are properly connected.

## 3. **SMART Disk Health**

The SMART disk health check indicates potential issues with the `/dev/sda2` partition:

*   The Power-On Hours attribute (9) is high, indicating a long usage period.
*   The Temperature_Celsius attribute (194) is reporting a temperature of +27°C, which might be considered high depending on the environment.

## 4. **NVIDIA GPU Issue**

There are errors related to the NVIDIA GPU driver and ucsi_ccg initialization:

*   This could indicate an issue with the GPU or its drivers.
*   Reinstalling the GPU drivers or updating the system's Linux kernel may resolve this problem.

## 5. **Event Log Errors**

The event log shows two critical events related to disk usage and temperature:

*   The "x86/cpu: VMX (outside TXT) disabled by BIOS" error suggests a potential issue with virtualization settings.
*   The other errors indicate possible issues with the NVIDIA GPU driver, fan control, or system resource allocation.

To improve the stability of your operation, address these concerns by checking and adjusting the following:

*   Monitor temperature sensors and adjust cooling settings accordingly.
*   Investigate and resolve fan control issues.
*   Review SMART disk health attributes to ensure data integrity.
*   Update NVIDIA GPU drivers and verify their functionality.
*   Examine event log errors for potential system configuration or hardware problems.

This will help stabilize the operation, reduce the risk of equipment failure, and maintain overall system performance.
