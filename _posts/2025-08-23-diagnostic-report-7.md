# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Cooling**: The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate inadequate cooling or insufficient airflow. This could lead to overheating, reduced performance, and potential hardware damage.
* **GPU Temperature**: Similarly, the GPU temperature is at 50 C, indicating a need for better thermal management.
* **Memory and Storage Usage**: The system's memory usage is 2480/32082 MiB, which may be causing some slowdowns or instability. It would be beneficial to free up more memory by closing unnecessary applications or increasing the physical RAM.
* **Swap Space Utilization**: With 0 KiB used out of 4096 KiB, it seems that swap space is not being utilized effectively, potentially indicating that the system's disk usage needs attention.
* **Filesystem Usage**: The /dev/sda1 filesystem has a utilization rate of 42%, suggesting that storage capacity might be insufficient. Consider adding more storage or monitoring for disk filling issues.

These points require immediate improvement to ensure the system runs stably and efficiently, preventing potential hardware failures and data losses.
