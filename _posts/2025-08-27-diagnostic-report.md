# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## 1. **Cooling System**

* The CPU temperature is high at 49.0°C, indicating potential throttling or performance degradation.
* The GPU temperature is also elevated at 50 C, which could lead to decreased performance and lifespan.

### Improvement Suggestions:

* Monitor system temperatures regularly.
* Clean dust from fans and heatsinks.
* Consider upgrading cooling systems (e.g., better fans, liquid cooling).

## 2. **Resource Utilization**

* The system's load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating sufficient available CPU resources.
* Memory usage is moderate, but swap space is almost full.

### Improvement Suggestions:

* Review system configuration and processes consuming resources.
* Optimize resource allocation and background process management.
* Consider increasing memory or adjusting swap space configuration.

## 3. **Storage Utilization**

* The root filesystem `/dev/sda1` has 42% used capacity, indicating potential storage issues.
* Regular backups are essential to prevent data loss.

### Improvement Suggestions:

* Review file system usage and identify areas for improvement.
* Implement a regular backup schedule (e.g., weekly or daily).
* Consider expanding storage capacity if necessary.
