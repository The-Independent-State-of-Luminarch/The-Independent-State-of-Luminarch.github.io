# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which is high and could indicate overheating.
* The system load average is relatively low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), suggesting that the system is not under heavy load.
* The GPU temperature is at 50 C, which is also high and may cause performance issues or even damage the GPU over time.
* The available GPU memory is very low (1024 MiB out of 6144 MiB used), indicating a need to adjust memory usage or upgrade the system if possible.
* There is approximately 2 GB of free memory available, which is relatively low and could indicate a need for more RAM.
* The swap space is fully available (4096 MiB), suggesting that it may not be being utilized effectively or there may not be enough physical memory installed.
