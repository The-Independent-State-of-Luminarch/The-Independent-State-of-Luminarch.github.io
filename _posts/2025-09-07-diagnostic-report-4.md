Based on the provided system report, I'll identify areas that require attention to improve stability:

### # Requirements for Improving Stability

#### 1. **Temperature-related issues**

*   The CPU temperature is high at `+35.5°C`, which might cause overheating and reduce the lifespan of the CPU.
    *   **Solution:** Ensure proper cooling, clean dust from the fans and heatsinks, and consider upgrading to a liquid cooling system if necessary.

#### 2. **Fan failure**

*   The fan1 reading is `0 RPM`, indicating that it's not functioning correctly. This might cause the CPU temperature to rise further.
    *   **Solution:** Check if the fan is properly connected and clean the dust from the fans. Replace the faulty fan with a new one if necessary.

#### 3. **SMART errors**

*   The disk `/dev/sda` has a pending sector count of `49`, indicating potential data loss or corruption.
    *   **Solution:** Run a full disk check using `fsck` to identify and repair any issues.

#### 4. **Power-Off_Retract_Count**

*   This attribute is high at `35` on `/dev/sdb2`, which might indicate frequent power cycles or improper shutdowns.
    *   **Solution:** Investigate the cause of these events, such as a faulty power supply unit (PSU) or an improperly configured system. Consider replacing the PSU if necessary.

#### 5. **nvidia-drm errors**

*   The repeated `Failed to grab modeset ownership` errors indicate issues with the NVIDIA graphics driver.
    *   **Solution:** Try updating the NVIDIA drivers to the latest version, and ensure that they are properly configured for your system.

By addressing these areas, you can improve the overall stability of your system:

### # Recommended Action Items

1.  Perform a full disk check using `fsck` on `/dev/sda`.
2.  Replace the faulty fan with a new one.
3.  Investigate and resolve any potential issues with power cycles or improper shutdowns.
4.  Update the NVIDIA drivers to the latest version.
5.  Monitor system temperatures and ensure proper cooling.

By completing these steps, you can enhance the reliability and performance of your operation:
