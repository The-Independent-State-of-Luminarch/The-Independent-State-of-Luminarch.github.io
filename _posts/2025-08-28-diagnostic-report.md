\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## Cooling System
* The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which is above a safe operating temperature.
	+ This indicates a potential issue with cooling, as high temperatures can lead to thermal throttling and system instability.
* The GPU temperature is also at 50 C, indicating a similar issue.

## Resource Allocation
* Low load average (0.12, 0.10, 0.05) suggests that the system is underutilized, but this might not be an immediate concern.
	+ However, if the low utilization is due to inefficient resource allocation, it could lead to bottlenecks and reduced performance.

## Memory Management
* Low free memory (2480 MiB) indicates that the system is running low on available memory.
	+ This can cause performance issues, especially when combined with a high load or intense usage of memory-intensive applications.

## File System Health
* The file system `/dev/sda1` has 42% used out of its total capacity (50G).
	+ Although it's not extremely low, it might be a concern for future growth and expansion. It could also indicate an issue with data management or cleanup procedures.
