# Requirements for Improving Stability

## 1. Check and address temperature-related issues

*   **AUXTIN0** (-128.0°C) and **in1** (1000.00 mV ALARM) on `nct6791-isa-0290` suggest a potential cooling issue.
*   The **SYSTIN** (+27.0°C), **CPUTIN** (+34.0°C), and **PECI Agent 0** (+32.5°C) temperatures are high, indicating overheating of the system.

## 2. Investigate NVIDIA GPU issues

*   Multiple error messages from `nvidia-gpu` (`i2c timeout error e0000000`) and `ucsi_ccg` (`i2c_transfer failed -110`, `ucsi_ccg_init failed - -110`) suggest potential problems with the GPU or its connection to the system.

## 3. Check power-related issues

*   Error messages from `x86/cpu` (`VMX (outside TXT) disabled by BIOS`) and `nvidia-gpu` (`i2c timeout error e0000000`) might indicate related power management issues.

## 4. Improve cooling performance

*   Address the temperature-related concerns mentioned above by ensuring proper airflow, cleaning dust from heat sinks, and considering a more powerful cooler if necessary.
*   Investigate and address potential BIOS settings that could be affecting system performance and power consumption.

## 5. Review system configuration and usage patterns

*   Verify system configurations (e.g., overclocking, voltage adjustments) are within recommended ranges to avoid component stress or damage.
*   Analyze system logs for any errors related to disk usage, file system checks, or other potential causes of instability.

These steps will help you identify areas for improvement and stabilize the operation.
