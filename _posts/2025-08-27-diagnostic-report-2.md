# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## 1. Cooling System Upgrade

* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which may cause overheating issues.
* The GPU temperature is at 50 C, indicating that the graphics card may also be experiencing high temperatures.

The current cooling system is inadequate to handle the workload, and upgrading to a more efficient cooling system would improve overall system stability.

## 2. Increased RAM

* The system is currently using 32082 KiB out of 32252 KiB (approximately 99%).
* Adding more RAM to alleviate memory pressure would prevent crashes and make the system more stable.

## 3. Disk Space Optimization

* The /dev/sda1 filesystem has 42% used, which indicates a potential for running out of space.
* Optimizing disk usage and possibly increasing storage capacity would prevent data loss and improve overall performance.

## 4. GPU Memory Upgrade (optional)

* Although the system currently has enough GPU memory, it may be beneficial to upgrade if future workloads are expected to increase the usage of the graphics card.
* This is a potential improvement rather than an immediate demand for stability.

These points address specific areas that require attention to improve overall system reliability and stability.
