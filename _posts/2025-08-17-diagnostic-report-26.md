# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

1. **Temperature Management**: The CPU and GPU temperatures are 49°C and 50°C respectively, which may indicate potential overheating issues.
	* Reason: Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can lead to hardware degradation or even failure.
2. **Memory Usage**: The system is using 2480 MB of RAM out of a total of 32082 MB (7.7% usage), which may not be indicative of a memory-related issue.
	* Reason: Adequate free memory ensures the system can handle increased workloads without significant performance degradation.
3. **Swap Space Usage**: The swap space is not being used, indicating that the system has sufficient free RAM to accommodate temporary storage needs.
	* Reason: Excessive use of swap space can lead to slower performance due to disk I/O overhead.
4. **File System Health**: The file system usage is at 42% capacity on `/dev/sda1`, which may not be a significant concern.
	* Reason: Frequent file system full conditions can lead to reduced storage capacity, and in severe cases, system crashes.

Note: These points require monitoring over time to assess their impact on system stability.
