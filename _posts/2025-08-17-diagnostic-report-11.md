# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling.
* The system load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but it's still a good idea to monitor and maintain optimal load levels for smooth performance.
* The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is relatively high and may cause performance issues or damage the hardware over time.
* The system memory usage is moderate (32082 2480 27602), with some free memory available. However, it's recommended to keep at least 20-30% of RAM free for optimal performance.
* The swap space is minimal (4096 0 4096), which may cause issues if the system runs low on physical memory.
* The file system usage is moderate (42%), with some available disk space. However, it's recommended to maintain at least 20-30% of free disk space for optimal performance and to prevent potential issues.
