# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## System Temperatures
- CPU Temp: 49.0°C ( potentially high, might cause thermal throttling or other issues )
- GPU Temp: 50 C ( similarly, high temperature could impact performance )

## Resource Utilization
- Load average is low ( 0.12, 0.10, 0.05 ), suggesting that system resources are not fully utilized at this time.
- Memory usage (32082/27602) and swap space (4096/4096) indicate that there's still ample free memory and swap available.

## File System
- `/dev/sda1` has a moderate utilization rate of 42% with sufficient disk space available. However, ongoing disk operations might benefit from better monitoring for performance optimization.
 
Considering these details, to enhance stability, it would be beneficial to address the high system temperatures as soon as possible, possibly through improving cooling mechanisms or exploring thermal throttling management techniques in software settings.
