# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which is high and may lead to throttling or reduced performance.
	+ Recommendation: Check for adequate cooling, clean dust from CPU cooler, consider adding a fan or liquid cooling solution if necessary.
* High system load averages (0.12, 0.10, 0.05) suggest that the system might be overloaded, potentially causing crashes or slowdowns.
	+ Recommendation: Review resource-intensive processes, close unnecessary applications, and consider increasing memory or processing power to meet demand.
* The GPU temperature is at 50°C, which may lead to reduced performance or even hardware damage.
	+ Recommendation: Check for adequate cooling, clean dust from the GPU cooler, consider adding a fan or liquid cooling solution if necessary.
* Only 25% of GPU memory (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB) is being used. This suggests that either memory-intensive tasks are not being run frequently enough, or other processes might be occupying the unused space without need.
	+ Recommendation: Monitor and adjust GPU settings as needed to ensure sufficient performance.
* The system uses a considerable amount of memory (32082 / 2480 / 27602), indicating a balance between active and idle resources. However, monitoring should continue for anomalies or spikes.
* Low swap usage (4096 0 4096) indicates that the system has not utilized its allocated swap space, suggesting adequate physical memory for most processes.
* Filesystem usage is at 42% for /dev/sda1. Although within normal range, continuous use near this level may lead to disk issues in future if write patterns become intense and consistent over long periods.
	+ Recommendation: Monitor usage trends to prevent hitting capacity before the drive's potential maximum lifetime has been utilized efficiently or to upgrade storage space.
