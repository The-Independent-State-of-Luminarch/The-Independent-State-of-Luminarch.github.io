# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C which might be slightly above optimal levels, potentially indicating inadequate cooling.
* The system load average is relatively low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but this does not necessarily indicate stability issues.
* The GPU temperature is at 50 C, which is quite high and may lead to reduced performance or even damage the hardware over time.
* There is ample memory available, with 32082 used out of 32768 MB total memory, suggesting sufficient resources for current processes.
* The swap usage is minimal (4096 used out of 4096), indicating no apparent need to activate virtual memory yet.
* File system utilization on /dev/sda1 is moderate (42% used out of available space).
