# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## System Monitoring Indicators

- The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which may be within a safe operating range but could benefit from proper cooling to prevent overheating.
- The system load average (0.12, 0.10, 0.05) indicates normal usage levels without excessive loading on the CPU or memory.

## Hardware Resources

- The GPU temperature is at 50 C, which suggests moderate use of graphics resources and may require additional cooling for sustained high-performance applications.
- GPU Memory Usage: Out of 6144 MiB available, 1024 MiB are in use. This leaves a significant buffer but might indicate that more RAM or improved GPU memory allocation could improve performance under load.

## System Resource Allocation

- Mem: Total system memory (32082) is predominantly unused with 2480 MiB actively utilized out of approximately 30 GiB total capacity. This may imply inefficient usage patterns.
- Swap: The swap partition is available, which could be utilized if there are concerns about memory shortages but ideally should remain empty as much as possible for performance reasons.

## Storage Capacity

- /dev/sda1 has 20 GiB used out of a total of 50 GiB (28 GiB remaining). This utilization rate indicates the need to monitor disk space usage to prevent reaching capacity.
