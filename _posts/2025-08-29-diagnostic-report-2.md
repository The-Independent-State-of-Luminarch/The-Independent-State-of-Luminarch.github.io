# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Overheating
The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which is higher than the optimal operating range. This could lead to decreased performance and potentially even damage to the hardware.

## Inconsistent Load Average
The load average is fluctuating between 0.12, 0.10, and 0.05, indicating inconsistent system usage patterns. This might indicate issues with resource management or inefficient process handling.

## GPU Overheating
The GPU temperature is at 50°C, which is relatively high for optimal performance. This could lead to reduced graphics performance, overheating issues, and potentially even hardware damage.

## Inadequate RAM Utilization
Despite having sufficient memory (32082MiB used out of a possible 32GiB), the system is utilizing only 2480MiB. This suggests that the system may not be optimized for the tasks it is performing.

## Swap Space Issues
The swap space is not being utilized, as shown by the zero usage and availability of 4096 MiB. This indicates that the system may not be configured to handle memory-intensive processes effectively.

## Disk Utilization
The /dev/sda1 disk has a relatively high usage rate (42%), indicating that the system may require additional storage space or optimization of data management.

These specific points highlight potential issues with CPU and GPU performance, resource utilization, and disk capacity. Addressing these concerns will improve overall system stability and reliability.
