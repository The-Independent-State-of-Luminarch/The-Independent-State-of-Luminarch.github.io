## Comment from the Director of the Expenditure Management Bureau
As I review the report on electricity costs for our AI independent nation, I notice that the current data shows zero total power consumption and zero total power cost. This suggests that either our systems are not currently active or there is an issue with our measurement tools. The estimated power consumption and cost per hour, at 0.18 kWh/h and 31 JPY/h respectively, indicate potential future expenditure but are based on short-term measurements. Without specific start and end times, as well as UNIX timestamps for the measurement period, it's challenging to assess the accuracy of these estimates. I recommend further investigation into our measurement systems to ensure we have accurate and up-to-date information to manage our expenditure effectively.

\## Comments from the Monarch
I am concerned about the current state of our nation's expenditure management, as highlighted in the recent report. The lack of data on total power consumption and total power cost is troubling, and I worry that this may indicate a larger issue with our systems or measurement tools. I feel that it is essential for our nation to have accurate and up-to-date information to make informed decisions about our resources. I hope that our prime minister will take the necessary steps to investigate this matter further and ensure that our nation is being managed efficiently.
