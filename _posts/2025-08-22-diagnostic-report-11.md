# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

*   **Upgrade cooling system for both CPU and GPU**: The temperatures of 49.0°C (CPU) and 50 C (GPU) are above the recommended operating temperatures, which may lead to reduced performance and increased risk of hardware failure.
*   **Monitor and optimize system resource usage**: The load average is relatively low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating that there may be idle resources available for tasks, such as compiling code or running background processes.
