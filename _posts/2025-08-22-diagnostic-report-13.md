# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

*   The CPU temperature is 49.0°C which might be on the higher side, indicating potential overheating issues. **Recommendation:** Monitor the CPU temperature regularly and take measures to cool it down if necessary.
*   The system's memory usage is high (32082/2480) indicating possible memory-related issues or inefficient resource allocation. **Recommendation:** Investigate the reasons for high memory usage and optimize resource allocation.
*   The swap space is not being used efficiently (0/4096). **Recommendation:** Monitor and adjust the system settings to use swap space more effectively when RAM is running low.
*   The GPU temperature is 50 C which might indicate overheating. **Recommendation:** Investigate and resolve any issues related to the GPU's cooling system.
*   There is considerable unused space on /dev/sda1 (28G/20G), indicating possible inefficiencies in storage allocation. **Recommendation:** Evaluate and optimize storage usage for better performance.
