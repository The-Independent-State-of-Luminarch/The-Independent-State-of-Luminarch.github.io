\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Temp: 49.0°C
* Reduce the CPU load by optimizing application usage and reducing unnecessary processes.
* Ensure adequate cooling to prevent overheating.

## Load Average: 0.12, 0.10, 0.05
* Review system configuration for efficient resource allocation.
* Identify and prioritize critical processes to ensure timely completion.

## GPU Temp: 50 C
* Maintain proper airflow around the graphics card.
* Monitor and manage system usage to prevent overheating.

## Memory Usage: Mem: 32082 2480 27602
* Free up physical memory by closing unnecessary applications and background tasks.
* Adjust swap space allocation for efficient data handling.

## Filesystem: /dev/sda1 with 42% usage
* Perform regular backups to ensure data integrity.
* Implement a maintenance schedule for disk defragmentation and file system check-ups.
