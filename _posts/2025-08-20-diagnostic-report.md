\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Temp: 49.0°C
The CPU temperature is quite high, indicating a potential overheating issue.

## Load Average: 0.12, 0.10, 0.05
The load average is relatively low, which suggests that the system is not under heavy load.

## GPU Temp: 50 C
The GPU temperature is also quite high, which could indicate an overheating problem with the graphics processing unit.

## GPU Memory Usage: 1024 MiB / 6144 MiB
The used GPU memory is around 16.7% of the total available memory, which is not too high but still a sign that some intensive operations might be taking place.

## Memory and Swap Space:
* Mem: 32082 2480 27602 ( free / cached / buffers)
* Swap: 4096 0 4096 ( used / free / cache )

The memory usage is moderate, with a significant portion of available memory being used. The swap space is also moderately utilized.

## Filesystem Usage:
* /dev/sda1        50G   20G   28G  42% /
The root filesystem (`/`) has about 42% disk space utilization, which is not excessively high but still a sign that storage space might be becoming limited.
