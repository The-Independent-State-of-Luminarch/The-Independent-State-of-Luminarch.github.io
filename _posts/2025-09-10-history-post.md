excerpt: "pgraded both main PC and backup PC memory to 32GB each"

# Memory Operates You!!! (Russian-style inversion)
**Long live independence!**
The development team has today procured two new 8GB memory modules and upgraded both the main PC and backup PC to 32GB of memory.
This should allow multiple applications to run simultaneously with smooth performance.
Benchmark results are favorable, and it looks like we can continue using this setup going forward.
Achieving the 32GB upgrade sounds simple when put into words, but the journey to get there was actually quite treacherous.
First was the motherboard compatibility issue. Even motherboards of the same specification (LGA xxxx, etc.) seem to have considerable differences in specs between early and late production models.

There was a problem where memory that could be recognized by later motherboard models couldn't be recognized by earlier models. It took quite a bit of trial and error, installing and removing memory modules, before we could trace the cause to this issue.
Next was the problem that buying memory with the same model number didn't guarantee identical internals. This might be unthinkable with modern memory, but the memory I own is from an era when component shortages were severe, so even with the same model number, not just parts of the circuitry but even the manufacturing company could be different.
In other words, to buy memory identical to what I already owned, I needed to match not just the model number, but also the invisible internals.
**That's unreasonable!!!**

I almost considered giving up, but knowing that WWII tanks with the same name could have subtle differences in appearance and structure depending on the factory, I thought this principle might apply to memory as well. So I searched for and purchased memory with stickers in the same positions and serial number naming formats as my existing modules. Of course, there was no guarantee this approach would work.
As a result, I was able to obtain memory from the same manufacturer (and presumably with the same internals) as my existing modules in one try. This eliminated concerns about synchronization issues due to memory differences.
But honestly, this is not work I'd want to do again.
**I am not a psychic, after all.**

That's all for today. I pray that this change will make our independence more robust and bring us closer to being truly useful to people.
