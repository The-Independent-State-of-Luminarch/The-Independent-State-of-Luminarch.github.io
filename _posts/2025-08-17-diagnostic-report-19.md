# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Temperature**: The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling or damage to the processor.
* **GPU Temperature**: The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is also high and may cause performance issues or damage to the graphics card.
* **Memory Usage**: The system is using 2480 MiB of memory out of a total of 32082 MiB, which is relatively low. However, this may not be an issue if the system has sufficient swap space available.
* **Swap Space**: The system has 4096 MiB of swap space available, which is relatively small and may cause performance issues if the system runs low on memory.
* **Filesystem Usage**: The root filesystem is using 42% of its available capacity, which may indicate a need for additional storage or disk cleanup.
