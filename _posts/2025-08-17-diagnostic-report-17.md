# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Temperature**: The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating. This could lead to reduced performance, throttling, or even hardware damage.
* **GPU Temperature**: The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is also high and may cause similar issues as the CPU temperature.
* **Memory Usage**: The system is using a significant amount of memory (32082 MiB used out of 32768 MiB total), which could lead to performance issues or even crashes if not managed properly.
* **Swap Space**: The swap space is being used, indicating that the system may be running low on physical memory. This can cause slow performance and increased risk of data loss.
* **Disk Usage**: The root partition (/) is using 42% of its available space, which could lead to issues if not managed properly (e.g., running out of disk space).
* **Load Average**: The load average is relatively low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating that the system is not heavily loaded at the moment. However, this may change over time and should be monitored.
* **GPU Memory Usage**: The GPU memory usage is only 1024 MiB out of 6144 MiB available, which suggests that the GPU is not being fully utilized.

These points indicate potential issues with temperature management, memory usage, disk space, and load balancing. Addressing these concerns can help improve system stability and reliability.
