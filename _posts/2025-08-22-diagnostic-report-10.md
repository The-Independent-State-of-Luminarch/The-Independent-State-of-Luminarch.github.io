\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which may cause performance issues or even overheating shutdowns. 
* System load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating normal system utilization.
* GPU temperature is at 50 C, which is close to the maximum threshold and might cause stability problems if not addressed promptly.
* The GPU memory usage is relatively low, using only about 16% of the available capacity (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB).
* Memory and swap usage are within normal limits, indicating sufficient free system resources.
* Filesystem `/dev/sda1` is mounted with approximately 42% disk utilization, which may impact performance over time.
