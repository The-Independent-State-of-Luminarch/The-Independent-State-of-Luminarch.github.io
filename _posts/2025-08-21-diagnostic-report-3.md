# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is high at 49.0°C, which may cause thermal throttling and reduce system performance. A cooling solution or a more efficient cooling system might be needed.
* The system load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating that the system has idle resources. This suggests that the system's usage pattern might not be optimal and could potentially benefit from better resource allocation or task scheduling.
* The GPU temperature is also high at 50 C, which may impact its performance and lifespan. Ensuring proper airflow around the graphics card and using a high-quality thermal paste could help improve temperatures.
* There is 1024 MiB of used memory out of a total of 6144 MiB, indicating that some portion of GPU resources is being utilized but there might be opportunities for further optimization to increase efficiency or performance.
* The memory usage on the system is moderate (32082), with 2480 used out of 27602 swap space. This indicates sufficient available RAM but potentially inefficient use of disk swap space due to lack of system memory, which should prompt a review of processes running in the background and possibly adding more physical memory to prevent swap.
* The root filesystem /dev/sda1 has only about 20 GB used out of 50 GB available. However, with an actual used size being 42% this means that more data is on other file systems.
