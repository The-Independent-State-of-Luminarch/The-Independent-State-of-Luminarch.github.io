# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## 1. Overheating CPUs and GPUs
The system's CPU and GPU temperatures are relatively high (49.0°C and 50 C, respectively). This can lead to throttling, reduced performance, and even hardware damage over time.

## 2. Inefficient Memory Usage
Although the GPU has ample memory (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB), the system is using only a small fraction of it, which might indicate underutilization or potential bottlenecks in the application running on this machine.

## 3. Insufficient Memory Allocation
The available physical memory (Mem: 32082 2480 27602) appears to be adequate, but with relatively low swap space usage (Swap: 4096 0 4096). However, the used percentage of swap might indicate potential I/O issues or insufficient system resources.

## 4. Disproportionate Hard Disk Space Utilization
The root filesystem `/` is occupying more than half of its total size, which may suggest inefficient file system management, inadequate maintenance (e.g., regular cleaning and deletion of temporary files), or insufficient storage space to accommodate system growth over time.

These areas demand improvement to ensure the system operates within a stable temperature range, optimizes memory resources efficiently, and effectively utilizes storage capacities.
