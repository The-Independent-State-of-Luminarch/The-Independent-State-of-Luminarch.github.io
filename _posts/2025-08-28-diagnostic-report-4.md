# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* CPU Temperature: 49.0°C - This is slightly high, a normal operating temperature for most CPUs is between 30-45°C. The system demands that measures are taken to reduce the temperature.
* High System Load (load average: 0.12, 0.10, 0.05) - This suggests that the system may be overloaded, which could lead to decreased performance and increased risk of crashes. The system demands that resource utilization is optimized and bottlenecks are addressed.
* GPU Temperature: 50 C - Similar to the CPU, this temperature is on the higher side (normal operating temperatures for most GPUs range from 30-45°C). The system demands measures be taken to reduce GPU temperatures.
* High GPU Memory Utilization (GPU Memory: 1024 MiB / 6144 MiB) - With only 16.7% of GPU memory being used, it is likely that the GPU is underutilized. The system suggests utilizing the available resources for demanding tasks.
* High Disk Usage (Mem: 32082 2480 27602; Swap: 4096 0 4096) - With low swap space and high RAM usage, the system demands more disk storage or better management of available resources.
* /dev/sda1 is running with 42% disk usage. The system suggests freeing up more disk space to maintain optimal performance and stability.
