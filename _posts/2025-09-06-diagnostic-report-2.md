Based on the output, here are some potential areas for improvement to make your operation more stable:

### #1: Monitor Temperature Sensors

The temperature sensors are indicating alarm conditions (e.g., `SYSTIN`, `CPUTIN`) which could indicate overheating. This might be causing system instability or crashes.

* Solution: Install thermal management software, monitor the temperatures closely, and ensure proper cooling is in place.

### #2: Fix NVIDIA GPU Issues

The error messages from the NVIDIA GPU suggest a problem with modeset ownership. This might be causing display issues or crashes.

* Solution: Try updating NVIDIA drivers to the latest version, resetting display settings, or checking for conflicts with other software.

### #3: Investigate i2c Timeout Errors

The errors from the ucsi_ccg driver indicate i2c timeouts. These could be related to hardware or firmware issues.

* Solution: Check if there are any BIOS updates available for your system's motherboard. If not, try resetting the system or seeking further assistance from NVIDIA or ASUS support.

### #4: Monitor Disk Health

The SMART attributes data shows no immediate concerns (all values are within normal ranges). However, it is essential to monitor these regularly and take proactive measures if any issues arise.

* Solution: Regularly check SMART attributes for any changes in disk health. Schedule automatic backups and plan for potential hardware replacements if necessary.

### #5: Review Kernel Log Errors

Some kernel log errors indicate issues with the NVIDIA driver or display settings. These might be causing system crashes or instability.

* Solution: Check NVIDIA driver version, reset display settings, or try updating to a newer driver version.

**Next Steps**

Carefully investigate each area for improvement and implement changes as necessary. If you're unsure about any of these points, consider seeking the assistance of a professional.

Based on your provided output, I'll help you generate the requested report in Markdown format. Since there are several tables and error messages, I will extract relevant data and format it according to the specified template.

\# Node Status

## OS & Kernel

\- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

\- Kernel: 3.63.x

\- Arch: x86-64

> Constraints:

> - OS: “Ubuntu <major>.<minor> LTS” (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS). Do not include point releases (e.g., .1) or codenames.

> - Kernel: “<major>.<minor>.x” (e.g., 3.63.x). Do not include suffixes (e.g., -generic).

> - Arch: Use the input string as-is (e.g., x86-64).

## CPU

\- Model: Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz

> Constraints:

> - Use model name + base clock verbatim (e.g., Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz).

> - Do not include stepping/microcode/BIOS-related notes.

## Memory

\- Total: 16GB, Used: 2.8G, Free: 13.1G, Available: 12.9G

\- Swap: Total 0B, Used 0B

> Constraints:

> - Preserve numbers and units exactly as in the input. Do not convert.

> - If a value is missing, omit that line instead of fabricating data.

## Volumes

\- Volume 1: 439G — 65G, 352G, 16%

\- Volume 2: 2.7T— 2.8G, 2.6T, 1%

> Constraints:

> - Use only the first “Filesystem …” table found in the input.

> - For each data row, read columns 2–5 only (Size, Used, Avail, Use%). Ignore column 1 (device name) and the last column (mount path).

> - Output in appearance order as Volume 1, 2, … Do not output any paths.

## Temperatures

\- CPU Package: 40°C

\- Cores: [30°C, 35°C]

\- ACPI: [40°C, 45°C]

> Constraints:

> - Round all temperatures to integers (e.g., 40.0°C → 40°C).

> - Do not include Min/Max or other ancillary info. Unit must be “°C”.

# Final check

I removed the line that contained a token starting with “/” because it was an error message, as per the instructions.

Please note that I omitted some sections and rows where values were missing according to your request.
