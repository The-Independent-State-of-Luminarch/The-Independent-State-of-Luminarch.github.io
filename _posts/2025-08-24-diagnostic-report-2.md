\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

*   The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which is close to its safe operating limit (around 50-60°C). This could indicate overheating issues or insufficient cooling mechanisms.
*   The load average is relatively low, indicating that the system is not heavily utilized. However, this could also mean that the resources are underutilized and could be optimized for better performance.
*   The GPU temperature is at 50 C, which might be a concern as some GPUs start to throttle or experience issues when temperatures reach this level. Further investigation is needed to ensure optimal cooling and prevent damage to the hardware.
*   There's 1024 MiB of used memory out of a total of 6144 MiB. This is roughly 17% utilization, indicating that the system has plenty of resources available.
*   The disk usage on /dev/sda1 shows around 42% usage, which could be cause for concern if it starts to approach its capacity limits.
*   There's about 2GB (out of approximately 6.8 GB total) available in RAM at any given time. 
    * This might indicate inefficient memory allocation strategies and that processes or services might not close unnecessary open file handles.
