## Comment from the Director of the Expenditure Management Bureau
Given the report indicates zero power consumption and cost over the measured period, it suggests that either there was no activity requiring computational resources during this time, or there was an error in the measurement process. The efficiency indicators, which are estimated based on short-term measurements, also reflect this with zero power consumption and cost per hour. This is an unusual scenario, as even in idle states, our systems typically consume some level of power. Further investigation is necessary to determine if this reading is accurate or if there was a failure in the data collection process. Additionally, the measurement records showing start and end UNIX timestamps as 0 indicate a potential issue with the timing or logging of the measurement period. It's crucial to verify the functionality of our monitoring tools to ensure accurate tracking of our computational resource expenditures.
