# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## 1. Upgrade Operating System
The current operating system is Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS, which is an older version. Upgrading to a newer version, such as Ubuntu 22.04 or later, can provide better security and performance.

## 2. Monitor Disk Usage
The disk usage of `/mnt/data` is very high (98%) on the partition `/dev/sdb2`. This may cause problems with data storage and availability. Consider moving frequently accessed files to a faster disk or reducing the number of files stored on this partition.

## 3. Maintain System Clock
The system clock is not synchronized with an external time source, which can lead to issues with timestamps in logs and other applications that rely on accurate timekeeping.

## 4. Check SMART Values for Disks
The SMART values for both disks `/dev/sda` and `/dev/sdb` indicate that they are within normal ranges. However, it is recommended to monitor these values regularly to catch any potential issues before they become critical.

## 5. Regularly Back Up Data
With the recent kernel errors being empty, there's no sign of an issue but regular backups can ensure data safety in case something goes wrong.

Based on the provided report and demands for stability, I will outline a plan to address each requirement:

### #1 Upgrade Operating System

- **Status:** Not yet addressed.
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or later.

### #2 Monitor Disk Usage

- **Status:** High disk usage reported.
- **Recommendation:** Reduce storage on `/dev/sdb2` and consider moving frequently accessed files to a faster disk.

### #3 Maintain System Clock

- **Status:** Not yet addressed.
- **Recommendation:** Synchronize the system clock with an external time source, such as NTP (Network Time Protocol).

### #4 Check SMART Values for Disks

- **Status:** No immediate issues reported.
- **Recommendation:** Regularly monitor SMART values to detect any potential problems.

### #5 Regularly Back Up Data

- **Status:** Not yet addressed.
- **Recommendation:** Implement a regular backup plan to ensure data safety in case of future system errors or data loss.
