# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* CPU temperature is high (49.0°C). It's recommended to ensure proper cooling or maintenance to prevent overheating.
* High system load average indicates potential resource constraints, which may impact performance or stability. Optimizing processes or increasing resources can help alleviate this issue.
* GPU temperature and memory usage are high. Monitoring GPU performance and adjusting settings or upgrading the GPU as necessary can mitigate this concern.
