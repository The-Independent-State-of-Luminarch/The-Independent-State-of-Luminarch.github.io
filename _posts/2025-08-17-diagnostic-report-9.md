# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling.
* The system load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), suggesting that the system is not heavily loaded at the moment.
* The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is relatively high and may cause performance issues or damage to the hardware over time.
* The GPU memory usage is only 1024 MiB out of 6144 MiB, indicating that there is ample free memory available for applications.
* The system memory (Mem) usage is moderate (32082 2480 27602), suggesting that some memory is being used but not excessively so.
* The swap space usage is minimal (4096 0 4096), indicating that the system is not relying heavily on disk swapping at the moment.
* The file system usage for /dev/sda1 is moderate (42%), suggesting that there is still available storage capacity.
