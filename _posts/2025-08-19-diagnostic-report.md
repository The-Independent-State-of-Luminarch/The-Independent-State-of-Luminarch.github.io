# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* CPU Temp: 49.0°C may be too high, consider reducing heat or improving cooling to prevent overheating.
* Load average is slightly above normal, indicating potential resource bottlenecks; consider optimizing system resources or adding more computing power.
* GPU Memory usage is relatively low (24%); no specific actions are recommended based on this data.
* System memory (32082 MB used) appears to be adequately allocated considering available swap space (4096 MB).
* The root partition `/dev/sda1` is almost full (42% usage), suggesting the need for additional storage capacity or disk cleaning.
