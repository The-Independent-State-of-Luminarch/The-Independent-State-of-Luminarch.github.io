# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling.
* The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but it's not clear if this is a normal or abnormal state for the system.
* The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is relatively high and may indicate that the graphics card is being pushed to its limits.
* The available memory is low (32082 2480 27602), which could lead to performance issues and crashes.
* The swap space is almost full (4096 0 4096), which can cause system slowdowns and crashes.

# Node Status

## OS & Kernel
\- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
\- Kernel: 5.x
\- Arch: x86-64

> Spec:
>
> - OS: “Ubuntu <major>.<minor> LTS” (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS). Do not include point releases (e.g., .3) or codenames.
>
> - Kernel: “<major>.<minor>.x” (e.g., 6.14.x). Do not include suffixes (e.g., -generic).
>
> - Arch: Use the input string as-is (e.g., x86-64).

## CPU
\- Model: Unknown

> Spec:
>
> - Use model name + base clock verbatim (e.g., Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz).
>
> - Do not include stepping/microcode/BIOS-related notes.

## Memory
\- Total: 32082, Used: 2480, Free: 27602, Available: 32082
\- Swap: Total 4096, Used 0

> Spec:
>
> - Preserve numbers and units exactly as in the input. Do not convert.
>
> - If a value is missing, omit that line instead of fabricating data.

## Storage (Physical Devices)
No information available

## Volumes
\- Volume 1: 50G — Used 20G, Avail 28G, Use 42%

> Spec:
>
> - Use only the **first** “Filesystem …” table found in the input.
>
> - For each data row, read **columns 2–5** only (Size, Used, Avail, Use%). Ignore column 1 (device name) and the last column (mount path).

## Temperatures
\- CPU Package: 49°C

> Spec:
>
> - Round all temperatures to integers (e.g., 40.0°C → 40°C).
>
> - Do not include Min/Max or other ancillary info. Unit must be “°C”.

## SMART
No information available
