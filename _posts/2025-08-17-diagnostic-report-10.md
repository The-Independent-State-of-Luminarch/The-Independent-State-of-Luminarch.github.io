# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Temperature**: The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling or damage to the processor.
* **GPU Temperature**: The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is also high and may cause performance issues or damage to the graphics card.
* **Memory Usage**: The system is using a significant amount of memory (32082 MiB out of 32768 MiB), which may indicate inefficient resource allocation or a memory leak.
* **Swap Space**: The swap space is not being used, which may indicate that the system is running low on physical memory and relying on disk storage for temporary data.
* **Filesystem Usage**: The root filesystem (/) is using 42% of its available capacity, which may indicate a need to free up disk space or expand the partition.
