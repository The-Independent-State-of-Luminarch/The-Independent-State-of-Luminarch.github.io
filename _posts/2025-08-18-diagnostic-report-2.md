# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## 1. Cooling System Upgrade
CPU Temp: 49.0°C indicates overheating, which can cause system instability. The temperature is high, indicating a need for better cooling.

## 2. Increased CPU and GPU Resources
GPU Memory: 1024 MiB / 6144 MiB indicates low GPU memory usage, but this may not be an issue if the application requires only 1 GB of VRAM. However, a more significant concern is the low swap space usage (0/4096) suggesting inadequate virtual memory.

## 3. Filesystem Optimization
The filesystem (`/dev/sda1`) has a moderate use percentage (42%). This may lead to disk I/O contention and performance degradation over time if not monitored.

## 4. Low Memory Usage
Low system memory usage (32082 / 27602) is relatively stable but can cause issues if multiple resource-intensive processes are executed simultaneously. This should be watched closely for potential issues related to process management and memory fragmentation.

No additional hardware equipment needed for improvement, the changes described would involve better cooling system configuration and adequate disk partition setup and allocation
