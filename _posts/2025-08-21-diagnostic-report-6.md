\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **Temperature Control**: The CPU and GPU temperatures are relatively high at 49°C and 50 C, respectively. This may indicate a lack of proper cooling system or insufficient airflow in the environment. 
* **Memory Usage**: The load average is very low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating that the system is underutilized. However, there is a large memory usage gap between the "Used" and "Avail" metrics.
* **Storage Utilization**: The file system /dev/sda1 is used up to 42% which indicates normal operation.

It seems the problem is due to missing information or more context is needed. Therefore no equipment is required to purchase, but more information would be helpful for better assistance.

Here is the extracted information in Markdown format:

\# Node Status
