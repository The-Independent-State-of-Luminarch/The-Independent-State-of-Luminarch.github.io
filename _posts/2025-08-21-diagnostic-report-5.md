# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* CPU Temp: 49.0°C may be a sign of overheating, which can lead to system crashes or decreased performance.
* High load average (0.12, 0.10, 0.05) suggests that the system is under heavy usage, potentially leading to instability and resource depletion.
* GPU Temp at 50 C may indicate that the graphics processing unit is working beyond its thermal design limits, which can cause it to throttle or fail prematurely.
* Only 18% of GPU memory (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB) is available for use, indicating that applications using the GPU may experience performance degradation due to limited resources.
