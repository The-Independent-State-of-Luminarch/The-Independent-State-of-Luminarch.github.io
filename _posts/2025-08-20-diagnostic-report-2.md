\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## Cooling System Upgrade
*   CPU Temp: 49.0°C, which is higher than optimal temperature range.
*   The cooling system should be upgraded or replaced to maintain a safe operating temperature.

## System Monitoring and Maintenance
*   load average (0.12, 0.10, 0.05) indicates moderate CPU utilization.
*   GPU Temp: 50 C is high; consider upgrading the cooling solution.
*   System administrator should regularly check for any resource bottlenecks to ensure smooth performance.

## Storage Management
*   /dev/sda1 is almost full (42% used), which may impact system stability.
*   Consider expanding storage capacity or cleaning up unused files and folders.
