# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## System Resources

*   The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may be slightly above optimal operating range. Improving airflow or using a better cooling system can help.
*   The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), indicating sufficient computing resources for current demands.

## GPU Resources

*   The GPU temperature is 50 C, which might be too high and can affect performance or lifespan.
*   Utilization of GPU memory is 16% (`1024 MiB / 6144 MiB`).

## System Utilization

*   The memory usage is low, with a significant portion available (28 GB out of 50 GB used on `/dev/sda1`).
*   The swap usage is 0.

No specific points need improvement.
