# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

*   CPU temperature is high (49.0°C), which may indicate inadequate cooling or excessive usage.
*   Load average is low, indicating that system resources are not fully utilized.
*   GPU memory usage is very low (1024 MiB out of 6144 MiB used), suggesting underutilization or unnecessary resource allocation.
*   Memory and swap space usage are within acceptable limits (less than 75%).
*   Filesystem /dev/sda1 is close to being fully utilized (42% used), which may lead to performance degradation and potential crashes.
