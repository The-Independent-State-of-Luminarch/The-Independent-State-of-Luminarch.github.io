# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## System Overheat Warning
- CPU Temp: 49.0°C is high, indicating overheating.
- GPU Temp: 50 C is critical, suggesting poor cooling system.

## Inadequate RAM and Swap Space
- Mem: Only 2480 MiB out of 32082 is available, indicating memory constraints.
- Swap: Although there is swap space available, the current usage is high at 4096, which may indicate system inefficiency.

## Disk Space Utilization
- /dev/sda1 has only 20G free out of 50G total capacity, suggesting a need for disk space expansion or cleaning up files. 

## Resource Utilization
- The load average is relatively low, but it indicates potential resource bottlenecks if multiple applications are running concurrently.
