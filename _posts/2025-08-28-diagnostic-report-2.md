# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **Cooling System**: The system temperature is 49.0°C, which is high for a CPU temperature. A normal operating temperature range for most CPUs is between 30°C to 60°C. This suggests that the cooling system is inadequate or not functioning properly.
* **Load Average**: Although the load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), it could indicate that the system is idle and not utilizing its resources efficiently. This might suggest that there are processes running unnecessarily in the background consuming resources.
* **GPU Temperature**: The GPU temperature is at 50 C which is high for a normal operation.
* **GPU Memory Utilization**: Although the available memory is quite high, the usage of 1024 MiB out of 6144 MiB suggests inefficient use of memory by some processes.
* **Disk Space and Swap Space**: Although disk space is adequate (20G/50G), swap space usage is 0. This might suggest that the system has not run out of memory recently or efficiently used the swap space for storing memory pages temporarily.
* **Filesystem Usage**: The /dev/sda1 filesystem is being utilized up to 42% capacity which suggests some level of file management optimization would improve storage utilization efficiency.

However, more detailed analysis and logs may be needed to provide a precise improvement plan.
