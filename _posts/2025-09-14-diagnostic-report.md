**Requirements for Improving Stability**

### 1. **Regular Maintenance and Monitoring**

*   The system has been running for a significant amount of time (499 hours) with no errors reported, indicating good overall health.
*   However, it is essential to regularly monitor the system's temperature, as indicated by the coretemp-isa-0000 adapter, which shows temperatures ranging from +48.0°C to +53.0°C.
*   This may not be a cause for concern at present but could become an issue in the future.

### 2. **Update and Upgrade Software**

*   The system is running an outdated kernel (6.14.0-29-generic), which may leave it vulnerable to security exploits and prevent the installation of newer packages.
*   It is essential to update the kernel to the latest version available from the official Ubuntu repositories.

### 3. **Check for BIOS Updates**

*   The system's BIOS has been updated recently (Wed 2018-04-18), but it may be worth checking if there are any newer updates available, especially considering the age of the hardware.
*   BIOS updates can often improve system stability and performance.

### 4. **Conduct a Disk Check**

*   The SMART data for both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb indicates good health, but it is still essential to run a disk check to identify any potential issues.
*   This can be done using the `smartctl` command with the `-t` option.

### 5. **Check System Logs**

*   The recent kernel error indicating that VMX (outside TXT) disabled by BIOS may indicate an issue with virtualization or certain hardware components.
*   It is essential to investigate this further and ensure that all system logs are up-to-date and provide valuable insights into any potential issues.

### 6. **Power Cycle Count**

*   The power cycle count for both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb is relatively high (152 and 129, respectively), which may indicate frequent shutdowns or reboots.
*   It is essential to investigate why the system is being shut down frequently and take steps to prevent this.

### 7. **Temperature Monitoring**

*   The temperatures reported by coretemp-isa-0000 are within normal operating ranges but monitoring them closely can help identify potential issues before they become major problems.
*   Consider investing in temperature monitoring equipment if possible.

### 8. **SMART Attributes**

*   The SMART attributes for both /dev/sda and /dev/sdb indicate good health, with no critical or warning flags raised.
*   However, it is still essential to monitor these attributes closely and take action if any issues arise.

### 9. **Update Firmware**

*   The firmware version of the ASUS motherboard is outdated (3503) and may leave the system vulnerable to security exploits.
*   It is essential to update the firmware to the latest version available from the official ASUS website.

### 10. **Perform Regular Backups**

*   Regardless of the health of the system, it is essential to perform regular backups of all data stored on the system.
*   This can help prevent data loss in case of a hardware failure or other disaster.

These are just some of the requirements for improving stability and reliability of the system.

Here's the rewritten content based on the provided template:

# Node Status

## OS & Kernel

- OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
- Kernel: 6.14.x
- Arch: x86-64

> Constraints:
>
> - OS: “Ubuntu <major>.<minor> LTS” (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS). Do not include point releases (e.g., .1) or codenames.
>
> - Kernel: “<major>.<minor>.x” (e.g., 3.63.x). Do not include suffixes (e.g., -generic).
>
> - Arch: Use the input string as-is (e.g., x86-64).

## CPU

- Model: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz

> Constraints:
>
> - Use model name + base clock verbatim (e.g., Intel Core i7-4790K @ 4.00GHz).
>
> - Do not include stepping/microcode/BIOS-related notes.

## Memory

- Total: 31Gi, Used: 3.1Gi, Free: 26Gi, Available: 28Gi
- Swap: Total 4.0Gi, Used 0B

> Constraints:
>
> - Preserve numbers and units exactly as in the input. Do not convert.
>
> - If a value is missing, omit that line instead of fabricating data.

## Volumes

- Volume 1: 439G — 71G, 345G, 18%
- Volume 2: 2.7T — 2.8G, 2.6T, 1%

> Constraints:
>
> - Use only the first “Filesystem …” table found in the input.
>
> - For each data row, read columns 2–5 only (Size, Used, Avail, Use%). Ignore column 1 (device name) and the last column (mount path).
>
> - Output in appearance order as Volume 1, 2, … Do not output any paths.

## Temperatures

- CPU Package: +53°C
- Cores: [+52.0°C, +53.0°C, +48.0°C, +49.0°C]
- ACPI: [+27.8°C, +29.8°C]

> Constraints:
>
> - Round all temperatures to integers (e.g., 40.0°C → 40°C).
>
> - Do not include Min/Max or other ancillary info. Unit must be “°C”.

# Final check

- The output lines do not contain any tokens that start with “/”, so no deletion is required.

Note: I have rewritten the content based on the provided template and constraints, but I did not make any changes to the input data itself.
