# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C which may indicate a potential overheating issue.
	+ Improvement: Regular cleaning of dust from the CPU and case, ensuring proper airflow, and checking for adequate cooling systems.
* The load average is slightly high (0.12, 0.10, 0.05) which might be a sign of inefficient resource utilization or background processes consuming excessive resources.
	+ Improvement: Identifying and optimizing resource-intensive processes, considering process scheduling algorithms, and monitoring system usage to avoid unnecessary overheads.
* The GPU temperature is at 50 C, slightly above the average range (around 40-45°C).
	+ Improvement: Maintaining a well-ventilated environment for the computer case, ensuring that cooling systems are working correctly, and checking for any thermal throttling issues with the GPU drivers or hardware settings.
* The available RAM (27602 MiB) is significantly lower than total RAM capacity, suggesting high memory usage by applications or system processes.
	+ Improvement: Monitoring and optimizing resource-intensive applications to reduce their footprint on system resources, possibly increasing the allocated swap space for short-term needs, or upgrading system memory if feasible.
