## System Status

- CPU Temperature: 60°C
- GPU Temperature: 80°C
- Memory Usage: 75% / 16 GB (3.8 GB used)
- Swap Usage: 0 MB / 4 GB
- Disk Usage: 85% / 512 GB (432 GB used)

Note: The system's CPU and GPU temperatures are slightly elevated, indicating potential overheating issues. It is recommended to check the cooling systems and ensure proper airflow around the computer. Additionally, the high memory usage may indicate a resource-intensive process running in the background. Consider closing unnecessary applications or increasing the system's RAM to alleviate this issue.
