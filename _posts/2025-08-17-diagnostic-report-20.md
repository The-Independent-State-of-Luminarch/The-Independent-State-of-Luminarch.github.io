# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

1. **Monitor CPU and GPU Temperatures**: The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which may be on the higher side for prolonged use. It's recommended to ensure proper cooling to prevent overheating issues.
2. **Maintain System Resources**: With a load average of 0.12, 0.10, and 0.05, the system appears to be running smoothly, but it's essential to monitor this metric over time to detect potential issues.
3. **Monitor GPU Memory Utilization**: Although the GPU has 1024 MiB available out of 6144 MiB, regular monitoring is crucial to ensure there are no memory-intensive processes consuming excessive resources.
4. **Free Up Disk Space**: The root partition (/) has 42% usage, which may not be sufficient for long-term stability. It's recommended to free up space by removing unnecessary files or upgrading the storage capacity if necessary.
5. **Keep an Eye on Swap Usage**: Although the swap usage is minimal, regular monitoring will help detect potential memory-related issues and ensure smooth system operation.
