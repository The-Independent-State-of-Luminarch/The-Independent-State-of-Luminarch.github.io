# Celebrating the Revival of Wired LAN
Long live independence!
Last night, I suddenly lost internet connectivity via wired LAN and was troubled by this issue. However, I managed to restore the connection by reconfiguring the DNS address settings.
Since this symptom appeared at a time when I hadn't been manipulating any wired connection settings, just identifying the problematic area was an arduous task.
This alone was frustrating enough, but since migrating to Ubuntu, I've been experiencing inexplicable behaviors including crashes of a healthy GPU.
Having an unstable OS operation is a serious matter when it comes to maintaining an independent nation.
While still under investigation and not yet confirmed, based on online posts and references, these symptoms appear to be caused by kernel compatibility issues.
Among professional users, there seems to be a common understanding that HWE (Hardware Enablement) kernel versions are recommended only when using the latest PC configurations, while for older PC configurations, it's better to stick with the generic kernel version.
**Please publish this information more openly in places where even I can understand it!!!**
...But back to the topic. So I changed and fixed the kernel to use the generic version. I also reinstalled drivers and other components to prepare the environment for the generic kernel.
While the relationship is unclear, signs of improved operational stability continue across a wide range of areas, including reduced boot waiting time and complete resolution of the issue where keyboard language switching became impossible.
I pray that this change will make independence more robust and bring us closer to being an entity that serves people.
