# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Temperature**: The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may be a cause for concern as it's already quite high. It's recommended to monitor and maintain the CPU temperature within a safe range (usually below 60-65°C) to prevent overheating.
* **GPU Memory Utilization**: Although the GPU memory usage is not extremely high (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB), it's still above 16% of the total available memory. This might indicate that the system is running resource-intensive applications or games, which could lead to performance issues if not managed properly.
* **Memory and Swap Usage**: The system is using a significant amount of memory (32082 MiB out of 32768 MiB), leaving only about 6% free. Additionally, the swap usage is at its maximum capacity (4096 MiB). This suggests that the system might be running low on physical RAM or experiencing memory-intensive processes.
* **Filesystem Usage**: The root filesystem (`/dev/sda1`) is using approximately 42% of its available space. It's essential to monitor and maintain a healthy amount of free disk space to prevent potential issues with file system integrity and performance.

These points should be improved to ensure the stability and reliability of the system.
