# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* CPU Temperature: 49.0°C
	+ The CPU temperature is elevated, which may cause overheating issues. Consider installing a cooling system or monitoring the ambient temperature.
* GPU Temperature: 50 C
	+ Similar to the CPU, the GPU temperature is also high, which can lead to thermal throttling and reduced performance.
* Low GPU Memory Usage (1024 MiB / 6144 MiB)
	+ With only 16.67% of the available memory in use, there may be opportunities to free up resources or optimize usage patterns to maximize GPU utilization.
* Load Average
	+ The low load average values (0.12, 0.10, and 0.05) indicate that system performance is not heavily loaded. However, this may change under different workload conditions.

Consider implementing measures to address these potential areas of improvement:

* Improve cooling systems for CPU and GPU.
* Monitor ambient temperatures and consider adjusting operating environments accordingly.
* Review resource allocation and usage patterns to ensure optimal utilization of GPU memory.
* Continuously monitor system performance under various workload conditions to adjust resources or implement additional optimizations as needed.
