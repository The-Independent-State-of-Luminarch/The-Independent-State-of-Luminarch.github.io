\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## CPU Temperature is High
The CPU temperature of 49.0°C indicates that the system is operating under heat stress, which can lead to performance degradation or even hardware damage.

## Unstable System Load
A load average of 0.12, 0.10, and 0.05 suggests that the system is not utilizing its full processing capacity, potentially indicating resource bottlenecks or inefficient task scheduling.

## GPU Temperature is High
The GPU temperature of 50 C also indicates overheating, which can cause performance issues, reduce lifespan, or even result in hardware failure.

## Low System Memory and Swap Space Utilization
Although system memory (Mem) is being used, only a small fraction of the available swap space is utilized, suggesting that additional resources might not be needed. However, monitoring this over time would provide more insight into potential bottlenecks during resource-intensive tasks.

## Filesystem Usage High on Main Drive
The usage of /dev/sda1 (the main drive) is high at 42%, which indicates a potential storage bottleneck or the need for data cleaning and/or upgrading to a larger drive if necessary.
