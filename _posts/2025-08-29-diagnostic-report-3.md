\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is 49.0째C which may indicate overheating, it should be kept below 40-45째C for optimal performance.
* The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but it can still indicate a need for more resources or efficient resource utilization.
* The GPU temperature is at 50 C which may cause issues and damage the component in long-term use.
* The available GPU memory (1024 MiB) is significantly lower than the total memory (6144 MiB) which could be improved by adjusting application settings to reduce usage.
