\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## 1. CPU Cooling
The system's CPU is running at a high temperature of 49.0°C, which can lead to overheating issues and potential damage to the CPU.

## 2. Low Load Average
The load average for the past 1/5 minutes is extremely low (0.12), indicating that the system is not being utilized efficiently and may be a sign of an underutilized resource or idle time.

## 3. GPU Temperature and Memory Utilization
The GPU temperature is at 50 C, which may indicate thermal throttling issues, but the GPU memory usage is only at 1024 MiB / 6144 MiB (16% utilization), suggesting that there may not be enough system memory allocated for demanding applications.

## 4. High Memory and Swap Usage
The system's total memory usage (32082 MiB) and swap space (4096 MiB / 0 free) indicate that the system is running low on physical memory, which can lead to performance degradation, slow-downs, and potential crashes.

## 5. Filesystem Space Utilization
The root filesystem ( `/` ) is at 42% usage, indicating that it may be time to clean up unused files or consider increasing storage capacity.
