Based on the output, here are some specific points for improvement:

### CPU Overheating
The system's temperature is quite high, especially the core temperatures, which can be a sign of poor cooling or inadequate airflow.

* Temperature sensors:
	+ SYSTIN: +29.0°C (high = +0.0°C, hyst = +0.0°C) ALARM
	+ CPUTIN: +37.5°C (high = +80.0°C, hyst = +75.0°C)
* Recommendations:
	+ Check and clean dust from the CPU cooler and surrounding areas.
	+ Verify proper thermal paste application and ensure the heat sink is securely fastened.

### GPU Errors
The system experiences frequent errors related to NVIDIA drivers and i2c timeouts.

* Event logs:
	+ [drm:nv_drm_master_set [nvidia_drm]] *ERROR* [nvidia-drm] [GPU ID 0x00000100] Failed to grab modeset ownership
	+ [drm:nv_drm_master_set [nvidia_drm]] *ERROR* [nvidia-drm] [GPU ID 0x00000100] Failed to grab modeset ownership
* Recommendations:
	+ Update NVIDIA drivers to the latest version.
	+ Reinstall or update ucsi_ccg and i2c packages.

### Disk Usage
One of the disks is almost full, which can cause performance issues.

* Filesystem usage:
	+ /dev/sda2 (root partition): 439G used, 352G available (16% used)
	+ /dev/sdb2: 2.7T used, 2.6T available (1% used)
* Recommendations:
	+ Verify file permissions and ownership for sensitive directories.
	+ Regularly clean up logs, cache files, or other temporary data.

### System Errors
The system reports some errors related to the NVIDIA GPU and BIOS settings.

* Event logs:
	+ [月 9月 8 14:10:34 2025] x86/cpu: VMX (outside TXT) disabled by BIOS
	+ [drm:nv_drm_master_set [nvidia_drm]] *ERROR* [nvidia-drm] [GPU ID 0x00000100] Failed to grab modeset ownership
* Recommendations:
	+ Update the system BIOS or UEFI firmware to the latest version.
	+ Verify proper installation of NVIDIA drivers and configuration.

To improve stability, consider addressing these points. Also, monitor system temperatures, disk usage, and error logs regularly for any signs of potential issues.

Here's a rewritten version of the output based on your suggestions:
