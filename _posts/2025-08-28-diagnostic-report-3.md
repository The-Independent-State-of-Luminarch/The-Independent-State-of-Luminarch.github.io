# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Temperature**: 49.0°C is slightly high, indicating a potential issue with overheating.
* **GPU Temperature**: 50 C is also on the higher side, suggesting inadequate cooling for the GPU.
* **GPU Memory Utilization**: The used memory (1024 MiB) is significant compared to the total capacity (6144 MiB), indicating a need for more efficient memory usage or additional resources.
* **Memory and Swap Usage**: 20G of disk space is being used on /dev/sda1, with a use percentage of 42%. This might be an indication of running low on storage space.
