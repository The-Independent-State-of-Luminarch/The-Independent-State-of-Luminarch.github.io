# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

*   The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C which is slightly above average but may indicate inadequate cooling.
*   The system has a moderate load average (average number of processes running) indicating potential inefficiencies in process management or scheduling algorithms.
*   The GPU temperature is at 50 C which indicates that it may be overheating, this could lead to throttling and reduced performance.

These are the specific points that should be improved to ensure stability.
