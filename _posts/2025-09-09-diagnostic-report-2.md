**Requirements for Improving Stability**

Based on the system report, several areas require attention to improve stability:

### 1. Temperature Monitoring

*   The `PECI Agent 0` is reporting a temperature of +36.5°C.
*   `CPUTIN` (CPU temperature) is also at +36.5°C.
*   `SYSTIN` (system temperature) is at +28.0°C, indicating the system might be overheating.

    **Reason:** Overheating can cause system crashes and damage hardware components.

### 2. Power Consumption

*   The system is using approximately 3.0GiB of memory.
*   The swap space is not used, which means the system has sufficient free memory.

    **Reason:** While the current memory usage is acceptable, monitoring this value will help identify potential future issues.

### 3. Disk Usage

*   `/dev/sda2` (root partition) has approximately 16% usage.
*   `/mnt/data` has only 1% usage on `/dev/sdb2`.

    **Reason:** Regularly monitor disk usage to prevent reaching full capacity and plan for potential upgrades or reconfigurations.

### 4. System Logs

*   The recent kernel errors suggest issues with the NVIDIA graphics card and ucsi_ccg drivers.
*   The system is experiencing multiple errors related to `nvidia-drm` master set failures.

    **Reason:** Investigate these errors further, as they may be indicative of hardware or software compatibility issues.

**Improving System Stability**

To enhance the overall stability and performance of the system, we need to address the concerns raised in the previous sections. Here's a concise plan to tackle each area:

### 1. Temperature Monitoring

*   **Verify Cooling System Functionality:** Ensure that all cooling fans are functioning correctly.
*   **Adjust Power Settings:** Change power settings to reduce CPU/GPU performance when not needed, which can lower temperatures.
*   **Monitor Temperatures Continuously:** Use monitoring tools like `sensors` or `lm-sensors` to track system temperatures in real-time.

### 2. Power Consumption

*   **Regular Memory Usage Checks:** Schedule regular memory usage checks (e.g., every two weeks) using commands like `free -h`.
*   **Monitoring Swap Space:** Regularly review swap space utilization to detect any potential issues with low free memory.
*   **RAM Upgrades:** Consider upgrading the RAM if system performance is impacted by low available memory.

### 3. Disk Usage

*   **Regular Disk Checks:** Schedule periodic disk usage checks (e.g., weekly) using commands like `df -h` to monitor root and other critical partitions.
*   **Data Purging:** Regularly clean up unused data on `/dev/sda2` and `/mnt/data`.
*   **Storage Planning:** Plan for potential storage upgrades or configurations if the system approaches full capacity.

### 4. System Logs

*   **Error Investigation:** Research kernel errors related to `nvidia-drm`, `ucsi_ccg`, and other issues, focusing on solving the underlying cause rather than just masking symptoms.
*   **Driver Updates:** Ensure that graphics drivers are up-to-date for optimal performance and stability.

### Final Check

After implementing these measures, monitor system performance, temperatures, memory usage, disk space, and logs for any improvements or new issues. Adjust your approach as needed based on the data collected from monitoring tools and system logs.
