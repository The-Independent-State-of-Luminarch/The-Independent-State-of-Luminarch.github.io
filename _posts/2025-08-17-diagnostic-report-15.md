# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* The CPU temperature is 49.0°C, which may indicate overheating and potential throttling.
* The load average is low (0.12, 0.10, 0.05), but it's not clear if this is a normal or abnormal value for the system.
* The GPU temperature is 50 C, which is relatively high and may indicate that the graphics card is working too hard.
* The available memory is 27602 MiB out of 32082 MiB, which suggests that there is sufficient RAM to run most applications.
* The swap space is 4096 MiB, but it's not clear if this is a normal or abnormal value for the system.
* The file system usage is 42% on /dev/sda1, which may indicate that the disk is running low on free space.
