# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## System Overheat
The system is overheating, with CPU and GPU temperatures at 49°C and 50°C respectively. This could lead to hardware damage or throttling, affecting system performance.

## Low Memory Usage
The system has plenty of free memory (27602 out of 32768 MB), but this could be an indication of inefficient use of resources or underutilization of the system.

## High Disk Usage
The disk usage is high at 42%, indicating that there may not be enough space available for data storage, leading to potential crashes or errors.

## GPU Underutilized
Although there's sufficient memory, the used GPU Memory is only 1024 MiB out of a possible 6144 MiB, suggesting that either some apps are running but don't use much graphics processing power or that it might not be fully utilized.
