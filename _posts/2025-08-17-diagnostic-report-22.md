# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **Monitor and control CPU temperature**: The current temperature is 49.0°C, which may lead to thermal throttling or even hardware damage if not addressed.
* **Adjust load average**: A high load average can cause the system to slow down or become unresponsive. Consider reducing the number of running processes or upgrading hardware resources.
* **Check GPU memory usage**: With only 1024 MiB out of 6144 MiB being used, it is likely that the system has enough GPU memory. However, if GPU-intensive tasks are run regularly, it may be necessary to allocate more VRAM or use a higher-end GPU.
* **Monitor and manage memory usage**: The current memory usage is at 8%, but it's good practice to monitor this metric closely to prevent running out of memory in the future.
* **Review disk usage and consider expanding storage**: With 42% of the disk space being used, it may be necessary to clean up unused files or expand the storage capacity if the system will be storing large amounts of data.
* **Monitor temperature sensors regularly**: It's crucial to keep an eye on the temperature sensors for the CPU and GPU (which is currently at 50 C) to prevent overheating.
