\# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

## Cooling System
* The CPU temperature is at 49.0°C, which may cause throttling or performance issues.
* The GPU temperature is also high at 50 C, indicating inadequate cooling.

## Memory and Storage
* Only 20G of 50G is available on the system's storage device (/dev/sda1), suggesting inefficient usage of disk space.
* Swap memory is available, but the low free memory (2.5%) indicates that the system might not have enough resources to handle high workloads.

## System Resources
* The load average is low, which may indicate idle resources or a underutilized system.
* GPU Memory utilization is relatively low, with 1024 MiB used out of 6144 MiB, suggesting there's potential for improved usage.
