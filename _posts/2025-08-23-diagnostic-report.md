# DEMANDS FOR STABILITY

* **CPU Temp: 49.0°C**: The CPU temperature is elevated, which can cause performance issues or even hardware damage. It's recommended to monitor and maintain a safe CPU temperature (usually below 80°C).
* **High load average**: A high load average indicates that the system is under heavy use, which can lead to crashes or freezes. It's essential to identify the source of the high load and optimize resource usage.
* **GPU Temp: 50 C**: The GPU temperature is also elevated, which can impact performance and longevity. Monitoring and maintaining a safe GPU temperature (usually below 100°C) is crucial.
* **Inconsistent memory usage**: The memory usage is not stable, with only 2480 MiB available out of 32082 MiB. This can cause issues with system responsiveness and may lead to crashes.
* **High used percentage on /dev/sda1**: The filesystem `/dev/sda1` has a high used percentage (42%), indicating that storage space is running low. Regular backups and maintenance are necessary to prevent data loss and ensure stable performance.
