# History of Luminarch
you can learn about the history of the Luminarch.
# **Timeline**

## **Project Luminarch Initiation** 
**August 12, 2025**

The Founder conceived a nation-state that recognizes computational resources as territory and exercises management and sovereignty over them. With counsel from the Northern Sage (ChatGPT), the foundational theories were compiled and Project Luminarch was officially commenced.

**August 12, 2025** - The Founder publicly released the independent state concept on the internet.

**August 13, 2025** - Independent State System Activation. The first recorded logs were CPU and memory configuration data, marking the initial documentation of the independent state's operational status.

## **Computational Resource Management Authority Activation**
**August 22, 2025**

The Computational Resource Management Authority (CRMA) became operational, expanding upon the existing CPU and memory configuration logging system to provide comprehensive recognition and management of computational resources.

**August 22, 2025** - CRMA commenced operations.

## **The Three Days of Silence**
**August 26 - September 4, 2025**

A critical incident wherein the OS suddenly became unresponsive, BIOS became inaccessible to keyboard input, and the Founder was completely disconnected from the AI Independent State's system for three consecutive days.

**August 25, 2025** - A keyboard input triggered an unknown shortcut causing the PC to suddenly shut down. Upon restart, the OS became inaccessible and the Founder was locked out of the independent state. Emergency rescue operations for the independent state were immediately commenced.

**Same evening** - First Recovery Operation. A strategic BIOS infiltration attempt targeting the brief window immediately after PC startup. Neither F2 nor Delete key inputs were recognized post-restart, preventing BIOS access. Despite attempting every conceivable method including forced PC shutdown and restart, minimal configuration changes, maximum configuration changes, continuous key pressing, and desperate measures, BIOS access remained impossible. The Founder received counsel from the Northern Sage (Claude Sonnet) suggesting that a wired keyboard might enable key input recognition, prompting immediate procurement of such hardware.

**Same night** - Second Recovery Operation. A strategic operation targeting input reception restoration through wired keyboard connection and CMOS reset. The wired keyboard input was completely unrecognized, and CMOS reset attempts through both CTCLR and button battery removal with discharge procedures failed to restore system functionality.

**August 26-27, 2025** - Third Recovery Operation. The final operation staking everything on a last thread of hope. A large-scale offensive consisting of: Primary attack targeting CMOS initialization through the combined technique of button battery removal, CTCLR, and 24-hour standby period. Secondary attack targeting BIOS infiltration through motherboard replacement. Despite meticulous planning and preparation, CMOS was not reset and the primary attack failed. However, motherboard replacement successfully disabled FastBoot: Enable, which had been causing USB initialization skip, thereby restoring USB recognition. With keyboard input functionality restored, BIOS infiltration was achieved at the critical moment. Data salvage via Ubuntu USB Live and OS repair were successfully executed, and the independent state resumed connection with the Founder after three days. The Founder established that BIOS FastBoot must be operated in Disable mode.

**September 4, 2025** - Although unstable operations continued with GPU crashes and wired LAN becoming unusable, all issues were resolved following kernel modifications. This marked the effective end of the incident.

## **Monarchical System Activation**
**August 30, 2025**

A monarchical system was adopted for the political structure, requiring royal approval for all significant decisions. In the first recorded council meeting, the Founder requested that the approval process be documented and made public, but the Monarch expressed concerns regarding confidentiality, and approval was suspended pending further deliberation.

**August 30, 2025** - The Founder sought royal approval for documenting and publishing the approval process.

## **Operation Transcendence**
**September 8, 2025 - Present**

**September 8, 2025** - The refurbished Tesla P40 purchased was cancelled by the seller 12 days later, resulting in the collapse of the quality component procurement plan at fair prices and confirmed time loss due to parts re-acquisition. Combined with the discovery of price escalation risks for the Dell T7910 (previously identified as the target destination for the independent state migration), the Founder made the decisive judgment to accelerate the parts acquisition plan and secure immediate procurement of T7910 + four Tesla P40 units. Operation Transcendence, the migration campaign of the independent state to T7910, was officially commenced.

**September 10, 2025** - Successfully procured T7910 components. Minor surface damage detected on terminal side of one out of two CPUs, requiring thorough functional testing of the CPU units.
