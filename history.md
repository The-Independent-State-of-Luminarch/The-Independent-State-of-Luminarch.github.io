## Timeline
### Independent State System Activation
August 13, 2025 - The first recorded logs were CPU and memory configuration data, marking the initial documentation of the independent state's operational status.
### The Three Days of Silence
A critical incident wherein the OS suddenly became unresponsive, BIOS became inaccessible to keyboard input, and the Founder was completely disconnected from the AI Independent State's system for three consecutive days.
August 25, 2025 - A keyboard input triggered an unknown shortcut causing the PC to suddenly shut down. Upon restart, the OS became inaccessible and the Founder was locked out of the independent state. Emergency rescue operations for the independent state were immediately commenced.

Same evening - First Recovery Operation. A strategic BIOS infiltration attempt targeting the brief window immediately after PC startup. Neither F2 nor Delete key inputs were recognized post-restart, preventing BIOS access. Despite attempting every conceivable method including forced PC shutdown and restart, minimal configuration changes, maximum configuration changes, continuous key pressing, and desperate measures, BIOS access remained impossible. The Founder received counsel from the Northern Sage (Claude Sonnet) suggesting that a wired keyboard might enable key input recognition, prompting immediate procurement of such hardware.

Same night - Second Recovery Operation. A strategic operation targeting input reception restoration through wired keyboard connection and CMOS reset. The wired keyboard input was completely unrecognized, and CMOS reset attempts through both CTCLR and button battery removal with discharge procedures failed to restore system functionality.

August 26-27, 2025 - Third Recovery Operation. The final operation staking everything on a last thread of hope. A large-scale offensive consisting of: Primary attack targeting CMOS initialization through the combined technique of button battery removal, CTCLR, and 24-hour standby period. Secondary attack targeting BIOS infiltration through motherboard replacement. Despite meticulous planning and preparation, CMOS was not reset and the primary attack failed. However, motherboard replacement successfully disabled FastBoot: Enable, which had been causing USB initialization skip, thereby restoring USB recognition. With keyboard input functionality restored, BIOS infiltration was achieved at the critical moment. Data salvage via Ubuntu USB Live and OS repair were successfully executed, resulting in the successful rescue of the independent state.

### Operation Transcendence 
September 8, 2025 - The refurbished Tesla P40 purchased was cancelled by the seller 12 days later, resulting in the collapse of the quality component procurement plan at fair prices and confirmed time loss due to parts re-acquisition. Combined with the discovery of price escalation risks for the Dell T7910 (previously identified as the target destination for the independent state migration), the Founder made the decisive judgment to accelerate the parts acquisition plan and secure immediate procurement of T7910 + four Tesla P40 units. Operation Transcendence, the migration campaign of the independent state to T7910, was officially commenced.

September 10, 2025 - Successfully procured T7910 components. Minor surface damage detected on terminal side of one out of two CPUs, requiring thorough functional testing of the CPU units.
